        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Perfect pancakes are easier to make than you think. 
        <br /> This pancake recipe produces thick, fluffy, and all-around delicious pancakes with just a few ingredients that are probably already in your kitchen 
        <br /> (and it's so much better than the boxed stuff).
        </p>

        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>3 ½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt, or more to taste</li>
            <li>1 ¼ cups milk</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Sift flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt together in a large bowl. Make a well in the center and add milk, melted butter, and egg; mix until smooth.</li>
            <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or pan over medium-high heat. 
            <br />Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake; cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, about 2 to 3 minutes. 
            <br />Flip and cook until browned on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter.
            </li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
